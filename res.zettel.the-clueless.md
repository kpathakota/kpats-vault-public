Cluelessness stems from self-delusion. This is notoriously easy to do (the easiest person to fool is yourself) and hard to self-identify after falling into the hole. 

Cynical take: When an organization starts, it's started by a sociopath (who's descended into nihilism and realized there is an absent god) wbo is able to control economic losers (folks who just want to be happy) and create social value. Over time, clueless folks get promoted out of the losers, become "company men" and cause the destruction of what they seeked to protect.
